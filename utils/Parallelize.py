class SimpleParallel(object):
    """
    A class to execute a list of Runner objects in parallel using a joblib instance.

    The `SimpleParallel` class allows for the parallel execution of tasks encapsulated by Runner objects.
    It utilizes joblib's parallel processing capabilities to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores.
    This class is particularly useful for running computationally intensive tasks concurrently, thereby reducing
    the overall processing time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Runner_list : list
        A list of Runner objects, each of which must have a `process()` method that defines the task to be executed.
    
    njobs : int, optional
        The number of jobs (processes) to run in parallel. If set to -1, the number of jobs is set to the number of CPUs 
        available. Default is -1.


    Methods
    -------
    single_run(i, Runner)
        Executes the `process()` method of a single Runner and returns its index and output.
    
    process()
        Executes all Runners in the Runner_list in parallel, returning their outputs in the original order.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> runners = [Runner1(), Runner2(), Runner3()]
    >>> parallel_executor = SimpleParallel(runners, njobs=2)
    >>> results = parallel_executor.process()

    Notes
    -----
    - The `Runner` objects must have a `process()` method implemented. This method will be called during the parallel
      execution.
    - The number of parallel jobs will be adjusted to match the number of Runners if there are fewer Runners than
      available CPUs.

class SplitJoinParallel(object):
    """
    A class to split a single Runner task into multiple parallel tasks and join the results.

    The `SplitJoinParallel` class takes a single Runner object and splits its task into multiple smaller tasks
    to be run in parallel. It uses joblib for parallel execution, and the results are combined (joined) after
    all parallel tasks are completed. This approach is particularly useful for handling large datasets or 
    computationally intensive tasks by distributing the workload across multiple CPU cores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Runner : object
        A Runner object that defines the task to be executed. This object must have methods and attributes
        necessary for splitting the task, such as `HaloLightConeCatalog`, `LightconeShell`, `cosmo`, etc.
    
    seed : int
        A seed value for initializing the random number generator to ensure reproducibility when shuffling
        the halo catalog (shufflying is done to load balance the jobs). Default is 42.

    njobs : int, optional
        The number of jobs (processes) to run in parallel. If set to -1, the number of jobs is set to the number
        of CPUs available. Default is -1.

    Attributes
    ----------
    Runner : object
        The original Runner object that is being split for parallel processing.
    
    seed : int
        A seed value used when shuffling the halo catalog. Default is 42.
    
    njobs : int
        The number of jobs (processes) that will be run in parallel. This is adjusted based on the number of 
        available CPUs and the length of the Runner_list.
    
    Runner_list : list
        A list of Runner objects, each representing a subset of the original task to be run in parallel.

    Methods
    -------
    split_run(Runner)
        Splits the original Runner task into multiple smaller Runner tasks for parallel processing.
    
    single_run(Runner)
        Executes the `process()` method of a single Runner and returns its output.
    
    process()
        Executes all Runners in the Runner_list in parallel, returning the combined output.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> runner = SomeRunnerClass()
    >>> split_join_executor = SplitJoinParallel(runner, njobs=4)
    >>> result = split_join_executor.process()

    Notes
    -----
    - The `Runner` object must have specific attributes like `HaloLightConeCatalog`, `LightconeShell`, `cosmo`,
      `model`, `mass_def`, `epsilon_max`, and `use_ellipticity`.
    - The number of parallel jobs will be adjusted to match the number of splits if there are fewer splits than
      available CPUs.
